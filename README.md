# ask.olin
### Anne LoVerso and Matthew Beaudouin-Lafon

Chatbot for prospies! Messages they send to the ask.olin Facebook chatbot are redirected to the askolin slack channel. Each prospie is given a randomly generated pseudonym to which students can respond with an @ mention or by starting a thread.â€‹

## Details

ask.olin is built with Flask, MongoDB (pymongo for Python integration), SlackClient (Slack's API python integration) and Facebook's Messenger API (more info on specific tutorials we used can found below). It is hosted on Heroku. 

To set up this project, clone this repository and push it to Heroku. Setup a Mongo database and set the mongo_uri as an environment variable. Set up an [outgoing webhook through Slack](https://api.slack.com/outgoing-webhooks) and [create a Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start) (only administrators of the page will be able to use the app unless you publish it). Set the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) and Messenger API tokens as environment variables on the server. Heroku should run server.py which will route messages between services!
